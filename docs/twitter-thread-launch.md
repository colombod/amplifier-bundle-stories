## Thread

**1/9**

What if creating a polished PowerPoint, case study, or project digest took seconds instead of hours?

Introducing **amplifier-bundle-stories** - your AI content team in a bundle.

Let me show you what it does:

---

**2/9** The problem we all know:

You ship something amazing. Now you need:
- A deck for leadership
- A blog post for community
- Release notes for users
- A case study for sales

Each takes hours. Time you'd rather spend building.

---

**3/9** The solution: 11 specialist AI agents

- Storyteller -> HTML presentations
- Technical Writer -> documentation
- Marketing Writer -> blog posts
- Executive Briefer -> summaries
- Case Study Writer -> narratives
- Release Manager -> changelogs
- Data Analyst -> dashboards

...and more!

---

**4/9** Five formats, one workflow:

[x] HTML - shareable web presentations
[x] PowerPoint - professional .pptx files
[x] Excel - data dashboards
[x] Word - technical docs
[x] PDF - executive one-pagers

Just ask in plain language. Done.

---

**5/9** It's as simple as:

"Create a PowerPoint about our new auth system"

"Make an Excel dashboard for Q4 metrics"

"Write a case study about the migration"

No templates. No formatting struggles. Just results.

---

**6/9** The real magic? Four automated recipes:

- session-to-case-study
- git-tag-to-changelog
- weekly-digest
- blog-post-generator

Your commits and PRs become professional content automatically.

---

**7/9** Get started in 30 seconds:

```
amplifier bundle add git+https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-bundle-stories@main

```

That's it. You're ready.

---

**8/9** Then just ask:

"Create a presentation about [your feature]"
"Run the weekly digest recipe"
"Write release notes for v2.0"

No more blank page anxiety. Your work tells its own story.

---
