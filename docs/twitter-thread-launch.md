**1/9** 🧵

What if creating a polished PowerPoint, case study, or project digest took seconds instead of hours?

Introducing **amplifier-bundle-stories** — your AI content team in a bundle.

Let me show you what it does 👇

**2/9** 😩 The problem we all know:

You ship something amazing. Now you need:
- A deck for leadership
- A blog post for community
- Release notes for users
- A case study for sales

Each takes hours. Time you'd rather spend building.

**3/9** 💡 The solution: 11 specialist AI agents

• Storyteller → HTML presentations
• Technical Writer → documentation
• Marketing Writer → blog posts
• Executive Briefer → summaries
• Case Study Writer → narratives
• Release Manager → changelogs
• Data Analyst → dashboards

...and more!

**4/9** 📄 Five formats, one workflow:

✅ HTML — shareable web presentations
✅ PowerPoint — professional .pptx files
✅ Excel — data dashboards
✅ Word — technical docs
✅ PDF — executive one-pagers

Just ask in plain language. Done.
