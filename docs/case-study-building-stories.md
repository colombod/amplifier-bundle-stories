# Case Study: Building the Stories Bundle

**A reusable content engine extracted from real-world needs**

---

## The Challenge

Every software project faces the same communication gap: brilliant technical work that nobody hears about. Release notes gather dust. Demos never happen. Stakeholders ask "what have you been doing?" while the team ships feature after feature.

The Amplifier project was no exception. The team had groundbreaking capabilities—shadow environments, semantic surfaces, multi-agent coordination—but turning technical achievements into shareable content required manual effort that rarely happened.

**The core problem:** How do you systematically transform technical work into presentations, documentation, and stories without becoming a full-time content team?

## The Approach

Rather than building one-off solutions, the team extracted a **reusable content engine** as a standalone Amplifier bundle. The key insight: content creation is a multi-agent problem with distinct specialist roles.

### Modular Agent Architecture

Instead of one monolithic "content creator," the Stories bundle defines **11 specialist agents**, each optimized for a specific role:

| Role | Agent | Specialty |
|------|-------|-----------|
| Orchestration | `storyteller` | Coordinates content creation across formats |
| Research | `story-researcher` | Mines git history, sessions, and APIs for raw material |
| Strategy | `content-strategist` | Plans which stories to tell and when |
| Writing | `technical-writer`, `marketing-writer` | Audience-appropriate prose |
| Leadership | `executive-briefer` | High-level summaries for decision-makers |
| Operations | `release-manager` | Automated release documentation |
| Narrative | `case-study-writer` | Transforms breakthroughs into compelling stories |
| Data | `data-analyst` | Metrics extraction and visualization |
| Adaptation | `content-adapter` | Format and audience transformation |
| Community | `community-manager` | Engagement content and responses |

### Multi-Format Output

A single story can be delivered in **5 formats**:

- **HTML** — Quick shares, GitHub Pages
- **PowerPoint** — Executive presentations
- **Excel** — Data dashboards and metrics
- **Word** — Technical documentation
- **PDF** — Final deliverables

### Story Archetypes

Rather than starting from scratch, the bundle includes **6 proven narrative patterns**:

- Problem-Solution-Impact (classic case study)
- Feature Journey (development timeline)
- Technical Deep Dive (architecture explainers)
- Release Announcement (what's new)
- Velocity Metrics (quantified progress)
- Community Showcase (contributor spotlights)

### Automated Workflows

Four recipes automate common content needs:

```
session-to-case-study   → Turn breakthrough sessions into shareable content
git-tag-to-changelog    → Generate release notes from git tags
weekly-digest           → Regular project updates with zero manual work
blog-post-generator     → Feature stories from git activity
```

## The Results

**Quantified outcomes:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Specialist Agents | 11 |
| Output Formats | 5 |
| Story Archetypes | 6 |
| Automated Recipes | 4 |
| Python Tools | 3 |

**Architectural wins:**

- **Separation of concerns**: Each agent has a focused role with clear boundaries
- **Composability**: Agents can be combined for complex workflows
- **Reusability**: Bundle works for any project, not just Amplifier
- **Automation**: Recipes eliminate manual coordination overhead

**From git history:**
- Initial extraction completed in one focused session
- Immediate refinements to naming and structure
- Documentation (including this case study) generated by the bundle itself

## Key Takeaways

### 1. Content creation is a coordination problem
No single agent can do everything well. The specialist model—researcher, writer, adapter—mirrors how real content teams work.

### 2. Format flexibility is essential
The same story needs different presentations for different audiences. Building multi-format output from the start eliminates rework.

### 3. Archetypes accelerate creation
Most stories follow predictable patterns. Codifying these patterns as templates lets agents focus on content, not structure.

### 4. Extraction creates reusability
By packaging storytelling as a standalone bundle, the capability becomes available to any Amplifier-powered project—not just the one that built it.
