# Introducing Stories: Your AI Content Team in a Bundle

What if creating a polished PowerPoint, a detailed case study, or a weekly project digest took seconds instead of hours? That's exactly what the new **amplifier-bundle-stories** delivers.

## The Problem We All Know Too Well

You've just shipped something amazing. Maybe it's a new feature, a successful refactor, or a project milestone worth celebrating. Now comes the hard part: telling the story.

You need a presentation for leadership. A blog post for the community. Release notes for users. A case study for the sales team. Each one takes time—time you'd rather spend building the next thing.

Sound familiar?

## Meet Your New Content Team

The Stories bundle brings **11 specialist AI agents** to your Amplifier setup, each focused on a specific type of content:

| Agent | What They Do |
|-------|--------------|
| **Storyteller** | Creates beautiful HTML presentations |
| **Technical Writer** | Produces deep, accurate documentation |
| **Marketing Writer** | Crafts community announcements and blog posts |
| **Executive Briefer** | Summarizes for decision-makers |
| **Case Study Writer** | Turns your work into compelling narratives |
| **Release Manager** | Automates changelogs and release notes |
| **Data Analyst** | Transforms data into visual dashboards |
| ...and 4 more specialists |

## Five Formats, One Workflow

Need a PowerPoint for that executive meeting? Done. Want an Excel dashboard tracking adoption metrics? Easy. How about a Word document for that technical proposal?

The Stories bundle supports:

- **HTML** — Clean, shareable web presentations
- **PowerPoint** — Professional .pptx files with corporate styling
- **Excel** — Data dashboards and metrics tracking
- **Word** — Technical documentation and proposals
- **PDF** — Executive one-pagers and final deliverables

Just ask for what you need in plain language:

```
"Create a PowerPoint about our new authentication system"
"Make an Excel dashboard showing this quarter's metrics"
"Write a case study about the infrastructure migration"
```

## Automation That Actually Works

The real magic? **Four automated recipes** that generate content from your existing work:

- **session-to-case-study** — Turn any Amplifier session into a shareable success story
- **git-tag-to-changelog** — Generate release notes automatically from git tags
- **weekly-digest** — Regular project updates with zero manual effort
- **blog-post-generator** — Feature stories pulled directly from git activity

No more staring at a blank page. Your code commits, PRs, and Amplifier sessions become the raw material for professional content.

## Get Started in 30 Seconds

Add the Stories bundle to your Amplifier setup:

```bash
amplifier bundle add git+https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-bundle-stories@main
amplifier bundle use stories
```

Then just start asking:

```
"Create a presentation about [your feature]"
"Run the weekly digest recipe"
"Write release notes for the v2.0 tag"
```

## What's Next

We're just getting started. The Stories bundle will continue to evolve with new agents, formats, and recipes based on what the community needs most.

Have an idea for a new content type? Found a workflow that would benefit from automation? We'd love to hear from you.
