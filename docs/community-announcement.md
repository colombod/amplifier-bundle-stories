# 🎉 Announcing: amplifier-bundle-stories

**Transform your project activity into professional content — automatically.**

We're thrilled to release the **Stories bundle**, an autonomous storytelling engine designed to help teams communicate their work effectively.

## The Problem

Great engineering work often goes untold. Writing release notes is tedious. Creating presentations takes hours. Case studies get deprioritized. Weekly updates become stale.

## The Solution

Stories automates content creation by understanding your actual project activity — commits, sessions, metrics — and transforming it into polished, audience-appropriate content.

### What's Included

| Category | Contents |
|----------|----------|
| **Output Formats** | HTML, PowerPoint, Excel, Word, PDF |
| **Specialist Agents** | 11 agents for research, strategy, writing, adaptation |
| **Automated Recipes** | Session→Case Study, Git Tag→Changelog, Weekly Digest, Blog Generator |
| **Story Archetypes** | Problem-Solution-Impact, Technical Deep Dive, Release Announcement, and more |

### Quick Start

```bash
# Install
amplifier bundle add git+https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-bundle-stories@main
amplifier bundle use stories

# Create content
"Create a PowerPoint about shadow environments"
"Generate release notes for the v2.0 tag"
"Run the weekly digest recipe"
```

### Automated Workflows

The recipes are where Stories really shines:

- **session-to-case-study**: Analyzes your session file, evaluates case-study worthiness, and generates a polished Word document
- **git-tag-to-changelog**: Complete release documentation from a single git tag
- **weekly-digest**: Blog post + email + social media, all from your week's activity
- **blog-post-generator**: Feature stories extracted from git commits

## Share What You Create!

We're building this for the community, and we want to see how you use it:

- 📸 Share screenshots of generated presentations
- 💡 Tell us about creative use cases
- 🐛 Report issues or suggest improvements
- ⭐ Star the repo if you find it useful
