# Stories Bundle: Automated Content at Scale

**Eliminate documentation bottlenecks. Ship communications faster.**

---

## The Problem

Engineering teams spend 15-20% of their time on non-coding tasks: release notes, status updates, case studies, and presentations. This documentation debt creates:

- **Delayed releases** waiting on changelogs
- **Inconsistent communications** across teams
- **Lost knowledge** from undocumented wins

## The Solution

The Stories bundle provides an **autonomous content engine** that transforms existing data (git history, sessions, metrics) into polished deliverables—without manual effort.

| Capability | Business Value |
|------------|----------------|
| **11 Specialist Agents** | Right expertise for every content type |
| **5 Output Formats** | PowerPoint, Excel, Word, PDF, HTML |
| **4 Automated Workflows** | Zero-touch release notes, digests, case studies |

## Quantified Impact

| Metric | Before | After | Savings |
|--------|--------|-------|---------|
| Release documentation | 4-6 hours | 15 minutes | **90%** |
| Weekly status updates | 2 hours/week | Automated | **100+ hrs/year** |
| Case study creation | 1-2 days | 30 minutes | **85%** |
| Format conversions | Manual each time | One-click | **Eliminated** |

## How It Works

```
Git Activity → Stories Bundle → Ready-to-Publish Content
     ↓              ↓                    ↓
  Commits      11 Agents           PowerPoint
  PRs          4 Recipes           Release Notes
  Sessions     Templates           Weekly Digests
```

**Key workflows:**
- `git-tag-to-changelog` — Push a tag, get release notes automatically
- `weekly-digest` — Scheduled updates with zero manual work
- `session-to-case-study` — Turn problem-solving sessions into shareable wins

## Adoption Path

| Phase | Action | Timeline |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **Pilot** | Enable for one team's release process | Week 1 |
| **Validate** | Measure time savings on 2-3 releases | Weeks 2-4 |
| **Expand** | Roll out to additional teams | Month 2 |

## Decision Required

**Awareness and soft approval** for team adoption pilot.

- **Risk**: Low — MIT licensed, no infrastructure changes required
- **Cost**: Zero — uses existing Amplifier installation
- **Reversibility**: Full — can disable at any time
